# CIM643CloneAnInteractiveInterface

In this project, we we will use JavaScript (mainly, but also HTML and CSS) to replicate an interactive interface.



First you will need to choose an existing interactive website to try to reverse engineer. Pick something that you are genuinely curious about. If you are looking for inspiration, The Coding Train YouTube channel has inspiring p5.js projects. For sleek and modern visual interfaces, Codrops’ Playground is a good source of cool experiments. For real-world projects, you can check the visual essays by The Pudding.



In this assignment, we consider an interactive interface any kind of user interface (usually visual) that responds to inputs from users. For example, an animation happening on screen in loop is not interactive. However, if that animation can be controlled by user by moving their cursor, then it is interactive.





Submit:

• Link to website (hosted on Github Pages, CodeSandbox, Webflow, etc)

• Video or screen recording of you interacting with your replica



P.S. If you decide to do this project in pairs, both students will receive the same grade
